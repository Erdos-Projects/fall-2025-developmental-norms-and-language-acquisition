Do Developmental Norms Predict L2 Difficulty? Modeling Duolingo Learners with WordBank Features

## Primary research question:
Do words acquired later in first-language development (L1) show higher error rates and slower learning in second language (L2) practice on Duolingo? We estimate the age at which a child learns a given word in L1 based on developmental norms as described by the [WordBank dataset](https://wordbank.stanford.edu/). We then compare this with the time it takes a [Duolingo](https://www.duolingo.com/) user to learn this word in L2 based on the [Duolingo SLAM Dataset](https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/8SWHNO). See also the article [*Second Language Acquisition Modeling*](https://doi.org/10.18653/v1/W18-0506) by Settles, Brust, Gustafson, Hagiwara, and Madnani.

## Data:

### Duolingo SLAM Dataset:
•	Large corpus of data from over 6,000 Duolingo users, collected during their first 30 days of learning a language
•	Released in 2018 as part of the Duolingo Shared Task on Second Language Acquisition Modeling (SLAM).
•	Potential features to use: practice history, time since last exposure, item difficulty, etc.
### WordBank Dataset:
•	Open database of children’s vocabulary growth.
•	Aggregates data from the [MacArthur–Bates Communicative Development Inventories](https://mb-cdi.stanford.edu/) (CDIs).
